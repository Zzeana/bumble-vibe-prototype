# bumble-vibe-prototype
## Tool Selection Update

This project was initially planned using Claude due to its strong design reasoning and recommendation in the assignment.

However, I switched to Cursor because it provides:

• Persistent project rules
• GitHub integration
• Strong support for iterative UI prototyping
• Better alignment with MCP-style workflows

Cursor is what I will now use as my primary tool for prototype implementation.

## Design Critique Feedback/Questions Asked:
Considerations: 
What happens when one person is really into the quests and the other abandons them, especially early on? 
Consider the flow of the sidequest assignment to matching to solving 
Do sidequests expire? 
Do you only complete them with one person? Or repeat them with many? 
Is there a reward for completion? 
Take a picture after the sidequest? 
Premium = additional sidequests per week 

## Iteration 2:
I used multiple Figma libraries and mainly focused on creating my high-fidelity designs and beginning my Cursor prototype. I plan to implement a few more screens and determine the most optimal flow once the prototype is more fully developed, which will help me better understand the overall user experience and interactions.

I also tried to match Bumble’s style and typography as closely as possible. I added screenshots I used for inspiration on a separate page in my Figma file to reference their layouts and visual patterns. Since I'm not a Bumble user and noticed variations in how certain screens appear across different versions, it was sometimes difficult to identify the exact design system conventions to follow, but these references helped guide my design decisions.

## Tool Selection & Justification

**Tool:** 
Claude is what I selected for this project due to its strength in design, figma plugin, and because of it's recommendation in the assignment. This project prioritizes interaction design, system states, and two-sided user flows, which aligns well with Claude’s capabilities. The Impeccable framework will be incorporated as the prototype evolves to support design quality.

## Version Control Strategy
This project uses Git and GitHub for version control. Changes will be committed incrementally after a decent output to allow me to undo anything in the event of unexpected behavior introduced by Claude. Before major revisions or experimentation, I will make a commit to preserve the previous code.
