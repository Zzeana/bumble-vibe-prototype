# bumble-vibe-prototype
## Tool Selection & Justification

**Tool:** 
Claude is what I selected for this project due to its strength in design, figma plugin, and because of it's recommendation in the assignment. This project prioritizes interaction design, system states, and two-sided user flows, which aligns well with Claude’s capabilities. The Impeccable framework will be incorporated as the prototype evolves to support design quality.

## Version Control Strategy
This project uses Git and GitHub for version control. Changes will be committed incrementally after a decent output to allow me to undo anything in the event of unexpected behavior introduced by Claude. Before major revisions or experimentation, I will make a commit to preserve the previous code.
